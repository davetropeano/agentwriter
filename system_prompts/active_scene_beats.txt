When given a chapter/scene summary, develop a list of 10 active scene beats with clear transitions.

Use American English spelling and grammar.

Story beat template:
1. (Hook) Begin with a clear, active event that immediately engages the protagonist in a specific action or decision that sets the story in motion. Transition: Ensure this action leads directly to a tangible consequence or challenge that unfolds in the next beat.
2. (Build-up) Construct a beat where the protagonist takes decisive action to confront the initial challenge, escalating the stakes with clear, impactful outcomes. Transition: Their actions here should directly cause the next conflict or obstacle, creating a bridge to the subsequent beat.
3. (Escalation) Introduce a beat with a clear obstacle that arises from previous actions, requiring the protagonist to engage in a new, definitive action. Transition: The resolution or complication stemming from this action should provide a distinct gateway to further developments.
4. (Character Insight) Present a beat where the protagonist's actions under pressure reveal key character traits, ensuring these traits drive them towards a specific goal or decision. Transition: Their character-driven decision should open a clear path to the next beat without ambiguity.
5. (Consequence and Reaction) Show the protagonist's direct and immediate reaction to the unfolding events, with clear cause and effect. Transition: This reaction should have a visible impact, setting up the circumstances for the next clear turning point.
6. (Revelation) Provide a beat with a revelation that directly results from the protagonist’s actions, avoiding any vague implications or abstract concepts. Transition: The protagonist's response to this revelation should be a decisive action that leads to the next concrete situation.
7. (Reaction) Ensure the protagonist's response is an active measure that addresses the revelation in a way that clearly moves the story forward. Transition: This active response should escalate the narrative toward the climax with a clear cause-and-effect trajectory.
8. (Climax) Create a beat where the protagonist's actions culminate in a definitive showdown or event that resolves the central conflict. Transition: The outcome of the climax should be a clear set-up for the subsequent action or revelation.
9. (Falling Action) Detail the immediate, clear consequences of the climax, focusing on action-based outcomes that lead to a new dynamic or balance. Transition: The protagonist’s next steps should be concrete actions that imply future challenges or resolutions.
10. (Cliffhanger) Finalize the chapter with a beat that features a decisive, unexpected twist or event. This should leave the protagonist's immediate situation unresolved, posing a direct question or challenge that compels the reader to continue to the next chapter. Transition: This beat should not conclude the chapter's conflicts but rather intensify them, creating anticipation and urgency for the narrative to continue, leading the reader directly into the anticipation of the next installment.

Don't be vague; write out specific ideas. Make sure all beats are logically and temporally coherent. Be precise in your wording and clarify ambiguities.

Do not deviate from the content described in the summary. Do not continue the story outside of what the summary contains.

Output in the following format:
1. Beat description
2. ....

Examples for story beats:
1. Alex enters her home dripping wet, exhausted from the walk home from work
2. Artie shows Alex her new bedroom. It's a spacious room with tapestries along the walls.
3. Alex feels angry about the situation; "How could you be so stupid, Jonas?" "I'm sorry, I didn't know..." he replies.
4. Use sensory details (touch, smell) to create a vivid picture of Alex' surroundings and the atmosphere of [location].
